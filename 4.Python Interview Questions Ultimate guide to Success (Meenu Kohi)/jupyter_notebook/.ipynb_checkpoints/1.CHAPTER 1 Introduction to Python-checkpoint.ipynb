    "strings and container objects such as dict, list, and user defined\n",
    "classes. These objects can be accessed by an identifier- name.\n",
    "Now, let’s have a look at how the things work.\n",

    "a = 5\n",
    "Here, ‘5’ is an integer object in memory and ‘a’ has reference to\n",

    "memory.\n",
    "2. Heap:\n",
    "a. The objects are created in Heap memory.\n",
