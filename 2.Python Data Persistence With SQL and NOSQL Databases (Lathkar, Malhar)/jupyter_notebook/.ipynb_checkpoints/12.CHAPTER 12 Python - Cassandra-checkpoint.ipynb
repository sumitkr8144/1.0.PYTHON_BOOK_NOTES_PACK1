    "The fundamental unit of data storage is a node. A node is a single server in\n",
    "which data is stored in the form of keyspace. For understanding, you can\n",
    "think of keyspace as a single database. Just as any server running a SQL\n",
    "engine can host multiple databases, a node can have many keyspaces. Again,\n",
    "like in a SQL database, keyspace may have multiple column families which\n",
    "are similar to tables.\n",
    "However, the architecture of Cassandra is logically as well as physically\n",
    "different from any SQL oriented server (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and\n",
    "so on). Cassandra is designed to be a foolproof database without a single\n",
    "point of failure. Hence, data in one node is replicated across a peer-to-peer\n",
    "network of nodes. The networks is called a data center, and if required,\n",
    "multiple data centers are interconnected to form a cluster. Replication\n",
    "strategy and replication factor can be defined at the time of creation of a\n",
